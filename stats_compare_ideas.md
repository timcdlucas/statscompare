stats compare
-------------------


just comparisons of two similar things with a picture for each



neural network 5 Vs 10 units

neural network 1 Vs 2 deep

neural network drop out Vs not



random forest Vs tree X


random forest Vs neural network


imputation Vs extrapolation


mean impute Vs remove



linear regression with strong and weak prior

mcmc vs inla


compute time histogram? for inla Vs mcmc?

posterior Vs n with uninformative Vs weakly informative prior



t.test with equal and unequal variance

linear Vs robust linear fit.

parameters change with drop out Vs parameters change with l1


some model with Poisson Vs negbinom.


iid variance posterior with gamma Vs penalised complexity


plot with rainbow Vs good

bootstrap Vs frequentist

frequentist Vs bays uninformative

frequentist Vs Bayes informative


bootstrap Vs frequentist when normal is wrong


mcmc vs hmc?

hmc Vs nuts?


Newton raph Vs bfgs loss?



random Search Vs grid. same total n. sort, index, plot against error?



survival removing censored Vs correct

survival treating censored as death Vs correct



spde Vs random forest with locations

random forest lat lon Vs random forest with locations
